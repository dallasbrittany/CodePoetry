Code poetry is a way to transform programming languages into something inspirational and unexpected. It can highlight unique features of different programming languages, or, well, do whatever you want it to.

To find out more about the topic, you can look into code {poems}, a project by Ishac Bertran where a collection of these poems were printed in a book (http://code-poems.com/book.html). Or you can check out Stanford's page (http://stanford.edu/~mkagen/codepoetryslam). They held a couple of code poetry slams.

It's about time people realized computer science and creativity mix well.

Also, I don't claim that these are good, either as poems or as code..! ;) But they were fun to write, which is what I was going for. Try it out yourself.
